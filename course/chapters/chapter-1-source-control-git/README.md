# Chapter-1 : Source Control and GIT

Back to [Course Introduction](../../README.md)

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this chapter we will cover the fundamental tools you need to know to start a DevOps, SRE or platform engineering career from the beginning.</p>
<p> This starts with knowing how to work with files. 
  Source control allows us to work with files, collaborate with others and track changes and histrory of source code.
</p>

<p>We will also take a look at popular tools that software engineers use to work with files.</p> 
<p>What your will learn:</p>

<ul>
<li> What source control is</li>
<li> How to use GIT to manage source code</li>
<li> Learn about the basics of hosted source control systems</li>
<li> What an IDE is</li>
<li> Developer Tools</li>
<li> How to use an IDE as an engineer</li>

### 🎬 [Module 1: Introduction to GIT: Source Control](../../content/source-control/git/README.md)

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a> is the foundation of DevOps, Programming & Software Engineering </br> 
This is because it is a source code distributed version control system. </br>
In DevOps, you will deal with code, command line, documentation, scripts, automation, infrastructure-as-code and more. </br>
Generally, all of this involves writing files and storing them.
GIT is the system you use to store these files. </br>
</p>

<p>
In this module we'll take a read through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">GIT</a> to understand where it started and why it is so successful and widely used in software engineering. </br>
</p>

<h4>In this module</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is GIT</li>
  <li>Installing GIT</li>
  <li>Command line</li>
  <li>Create your first GIT repository</li>
  <li>Branching</li>
  <li>Commits</li>
  <li>Merging branches</li>
  <li>GUI Tools for GIT</li>
  <li>VSCode</li>
</ul>

### 🎬 [Module 2: Introduction to IDEs: Visual Studio Code](../../content/editors/vscode/introduction/README.md)

<p>
When working on source code using GIT, you will want to work on files and directories. </br>
This includes configuration files, code files, scripts and so on. </br>
To get a nice overview of all our files and folders, as well as have access to GIT and command line, we'll use an IDE. </br>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> is an integrated development environment. </br>
It is software that helps us deal with software development and engineering. </br>
</p>

<h4>In this module:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>What is VSCode</li>
  <li>Directory and File management</li>
  <li>Editing files</li>
  <li>Command line terminals</li>
  <li>Extensions</li>
  <li>Themes</li>
  <li>GIT features</li>
</ul>

### 🎬 [Module 3: Introduction to Github: Hosted Source Control](../../content/source-control/github/README.md)

<p>
Storing source code in a Git repository on a local machine carries a risk of data loss. </br>
If your harddrive crashes, or you lose your laptop, all your work would be lost. </br>
Therefore it's always recommended to use a hosted source control provider like Github, BitBucket, Gitlab and others. </br>
</p>
<p>
It also makes collaboration possible, when you have a team of people working on the same project </br>
</p>

<h4>In this module:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We create a Github account</li>
  <li>Overview of Github source control</li>
  <li>Integrating our repository with Github</li>
  <li>Working with our repository</li>
</ul>
