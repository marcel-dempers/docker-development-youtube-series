# 🎓 The Ultimate DevOps Course (early access 🚧)

This course is my ultimate guide to DevOps engineering for beginners </br>

<i>🚧 This course is currently under early access and undergoing constant review and updates</i>

## 🚀 Introduction

In my many years working in the field, I have noticed a range of challenges and problems that people face when trying to join the DevOps space </br>

## 🔴The challenges - <i>where to start ?</i>

 <b>DevOps has its challenges:</b>
* There is no simple starting point to start learning about DevOps
* DevOps requires a very broad range of skills that can be very overwhelming for new people to learn
* DevOps is often treated as "Dev" and "Ops" which means you need understanding of two broad fields
* DevOps technologies are littered with buzz words, such as cloud, AI, machine learning, CI/CD, scalability, immutable infrastructure, automation, security and it never ends

<b>Qualifications have its challenges:</b>

* Universities or Colleges offer IT degrees or courses, which often only cover traditional & "legacy" IT knowledge.
* They do not cover real world challenges faced when working with the cloud, or working with popular open source technologies or modern challenges that businesses face these days
* These technologies are often evolving at a rapid pace and traditional Universities cannot keep up with these.

<b>Cloud certifications have its challenges:</b>
* Cloud certifications often only focus on a specific cloud provider which can build bias
* Often only solve really specific problems, and miss real world problems
* Develop very narrow focussed problem solving skill
* Miss out on powerful open source skils
* Vendor locking

## 📖 Where to find the full course

The Youtube series will cover the course content so you can benefit from the course roadmap for free. </br>
However, the YouTube videos are in shorter, edited, summarised form. So although you may benefit from the content, if you are a beginner, you may prefer the long form content where I elaborate, provider more in-depth explanations and cover more examples </br>
